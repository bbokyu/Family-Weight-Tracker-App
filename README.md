# Family Weight Tracker App

___

The goal of this program is to help family members track 
and compare their progress of weight loss. While creating this app,
my main focus will be simplicity and user experience. This is 
because at the core of tracking weight loss, it can be achieved using pen and paper. I will not overcomplicate the process and let the user incorporate
the app as seamlessly as possibly into their weight loss journey.

## App Functionality
- [ ] Create new user with name and height information
- [ ] Manage one's weight and add new weight logs
- [ ] Access and view of progress between family members

## Target Userbase
I made this to app to mainly help my family members lose weight. It is targeted towards groups of people
who will be living together, but it can also be used by individuals
as well.

## User Stories
As a user, I want to...
- [X] Create and add members to my family
- [X] Remove certain members from the family
- [X] View the record of a family member's weight log
- [X] Add weight log entries to chosen member
- [X] Be able to save and load the record of family weight logs


## Sample output:
*Console*
```
Add Weight Log: 72.0 KG to Ethan
Add Weight Log: 65.0 KG to Bryan
```
*GUI*

## Improvements for the future
- [ ] Currently, GUI handles list of member. I would create 
another class called Family to handle list of members
- [ ] Separate GUI class to several smaller classes instead
of having one big GUI class
